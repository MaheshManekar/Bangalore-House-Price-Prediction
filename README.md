This project involes building a real estate price prediction website. The step-by-step process involves using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com and implementing a linear regression model with sklearn. The series encompasses three main components:

Model Building: The first phase entails data loading and cleaning using Python's Numpy and Pandas, along with data visualization using Matplotlib. Outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Flask Server: The second step focuses on creating a Python Flask server. This server utilizes the previously built model to handle HTTP requests and serve the predicted prices.

Website Development: The third component involves building a user-friendly website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input area, apartment configuration, number of bathrooms, etc., and the website communicates with the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

In this project used various technologies and tools, including Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
